# Specification: Hide Agent Window on Windows

## Objective

The primary objective is to modify the Arcade agent executable for the Windows operating system so that it runs without displaying a console window. This change aims to provide a less intrusive user experience when the agent is running in the background.

## Functional Requirements

*   **FR-1: Invisible Window:** When the agent executable (`agent.exe`) is launched on a Windows system, no console window or graphical user interface window should be visible to the user.
*   **FR-2: Background Operation:** The agent must continue to run in the background and perform all its intended functions (e.g., communicating with the web controller, executing tasks) without requiring a visible window.
*   **FR-3: No Functional Degradation:** Hiding the window should not negatively impact any existing functionality of the agent.

## Constraints and Edge Cases

*   **C-1: Windows Specific:** This specification applies only to the Windows build of the agent executable. The behavior on other operating systems (e.g., Linux) is outside the scope of this specification.
*   **C-2: Logging:** The agent's logging mechanisms must remain functional, allowing for troubleshooting and monitoring even without a visible console output.
*   **C-3: Build Process:** The modification should be implemented by adjusting the agent's build process (specifically, the PyInstaller configuration) rather than making significant changes to the core agent Python script's logic for window handling.
*   **EC-1: Errors During Startup:** Consider how critical errors during the agent's startup phase will be handled or reported if there is no visible console window. Logging should capture these errors.
*   **EC-2: User Interaction (None Expected):** The agent is not designed for direct user interaction via a console window. This change reinforces that design and should not introduce any need for user interaction through a hidden window.
