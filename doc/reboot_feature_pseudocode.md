# Reboot Feature Pseudocode

## 1. Web User Interface (UI)

### 1.1 Add Reboot Button

```pseudocode
// In the system tab component:
DISPLAY button with label "Reboot Agent"
  // TDD Anchor: Test that the button is rendered in the system tab.
  // TDD Anchor: Test that the button is initially enabled.
```

### 1.2 Handle Button Click

```pseudocode
ON "Reboot Agent" button click:
  DISABLE button to prevent multiple clicks
  DISPLAY visual feedback (e.g., "Rebooting...")
  SEND request to agent API to initiate reboot
  // TDD Anchor: Test that the button is disabled after clicking.
  // TDD Anchor: Test that visual feedback is displayed after clicking.
  // TDD Anchor: Test that an API request is sent to the agent.
```

### 1.3 Handle Agent API Response

```pseudocode
ON receiving successful response from agent API:
  START timer for reconnection attempts (e.g., 5 seconds delay)
  // TDD Anchor: Test that a reconnection timer is started on successful API response.

ON receiving error response from agent API:
  DISPLAY error message to user
  ENABLE button
  HIDE visual feedback
  // TDD Anchor: Test that an error message is displayed on API error.
  // TDD Anchor: Test that the button is re-enabled on API error.
  // TDD Anchor: Test that visual feedback is hidden on API error.
```

### 1.4 Reconnection Attempts

```pseudocode
AFTER timer delay:
  ATTEMPT to reconnect to agent WebSocket
  // TDD Anchor: Test that reconnection is attempted after the delay.

ON successful WebSocket reconnection:
  UPDATE UI based on agent's current status
  ENABLE button
  HIDE visual feedback
  // TDD Anchor: Test that UI is updated on successful reconnection.
  // TDD Anchor: Test that the button is re-enabled on successful reconnection.
  // TDD Anchor: Test that visual feedback is hidden on successful reconnection.

ON WebSocket reconnection failure:
  INCREMENT reconnection attempt counter
  IF reconnection attempts < maximum allowed:
    WAIT for increasing delay (e.g., exponential backoff)
    ATTEMPT to reconnect to agent WebSocket
    // TDD Anchor: Test that reconnection attempts are retried with increasing delay.
  ELSE:
    DISPLAY persistent error message (e.g., "Agent offline")
    // TDD Anchor: Test that a persistent error message is displayed after maximum attempts.
```

## 2. Agent Process

### 2.1 Handle Reboot API Request

```pseudocode
ON receiving reboot API request:
  PERFORM authentication and authorization checks
  IF checks fail:
    RETURN error response (e.g., 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden)
    // TDD Anchor: Test that unauthorized/forbidden requests are rejected.

  IF agent is busy:
    RETURN error response (e.g., 409 Conflict)
    // TDD Anchor: Test that busy agent rejects reboot requests.

  SET agent status to "rebooting"
  SAVE any critical state or data
  INITIATE graceful shutdown process
  RETURN success response to UI
  // TDD Anchor: Test that agent status is set to "rebooting".
  // TDD Anchor: Test that critical state is saved.
  // TDD Anchor: Test that graceful shutdown is initiated.
  // TDD Anchor: Test that a success response is returned to the UI.
```

### 2.2 Graceful Shutdown

```pseudocode
DURING graceful shutdown:
  STOP accepting new requests
  FINISH processing current tasks
  RELEASE resources (e.g., close file handles, database connections)
  // TDD Anchor: Test that new requests are rejected during shutdown.
  // TDD Anchor: Test that current tasks are completed.
  // TDD Anchor: Test that resources are released.

ON graceful shutdown complete:
  INITIATE agent process restart
  // TDD Anchor: Test that agent process restart is initiated after graceful shutdown.

IF graceful shutdown fails (e.g., timeout):
  LOG error
  ATTEMPT forceful termination (if necessary and supported)
  // TDD Anchor: Test that errors are logged on shutdown failure.
  // TDD Anchor: Test that forceful termination is attempted on shutdown failure.
```

### 2.3 Agent Restart

```pseudocode
ON agent process restart:
  INITIALIZE agent
  LOAD any previously saved state or data
  START accepting new requests
  ESTABLISH WebSocket connection (if applicable)
  // TDD Anchor: Test that agent is initialized on restart.
  // TDD Anchor: Test that saved state is loaded.
  // TDD Anchor: Test that new requests are accepted.
  // TDD Anchor: Test that WebSocket connection is established.

IF agent restart fails:
  LOG critical error
  // TDD Anchor: Test that critical errors are logged on restart failure.
  // TDD Anchor: Consider system-level monitoring to detect and potentially alert on persistent restart failures.
```

## 3. Edge Case Considerations (Integrated into Pseudocode)

- **Agent fails to shut down/restart:** Handled by logging errors and potential forceful termination/system-level monitoring.
- **Web UI fails to reconnect:** Handled by retry mechanism with increasing delay and persistent error message.
- **Multiple button clicks:** Handled by disabling the button after the first click.
- **Agent busy:** Handled by returning a conflict error response.
- **Network connection lost:** Handled by the WebSocket reconnection logic.

## 4. Constraint Considerations (Integrated into Pseudocode)

- **No manual intervention:** The entire process is designed to be programmatic.
- **Fast reboot:** Graceful shutdown aims for data integrity while being as fast as possible.
- **Responsive web UI:** UI updates and error handling are designed to keep the UI responsive.
- **Security:** Authentication/authorization checks are included for the API endpoint.
- **Programmatic reboot support:** The pseudocode assumes the underlying OS supports this.
