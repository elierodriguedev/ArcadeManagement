# Reboot Feature Specification

## 1. Introduction
This document specifies the requirements for adding a reboot button to the system tab of the agent's web user interface.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- A button labeled "Reboot Agent" shall be added to the system tab of the web UI.
- Clicking the "Reboot Agent" button shall initiate a graceful shutdown and restart of the agent process.
- The web UI shall provide visual feedback to the user indicating that the reboot process has started.
- The web UI shall attempt to reconnect to the agent after a short delay.
- Upon successful reconnection, the web UI shall update to reflect the agent's status.

## 3. Edge Cases
- What happens if the agent fails to shut down gracefully?
- What happens if the agent fails to restart after shutdown?
- What happens if the web UI fails to reconnect to the agent?
- What happens if the user clicks the reboot button multiple times in quick succession?
- What happens if the agent is busy performing another task when the reboot button is clicked?
- What happens if the user's network connection is lost during the reboot process?

## 4. Constraints
- The reboot functionality must not require manual intervention on the machine running the agent.
- The reboot process should be as fast as possible while ensuring data integrity.
- The web UI should remain responsive during the reboot process, even if it cannot communicate with the agent.
- The implementation should consider potential security implications of allowing remote reboot and include necessary authentication/authorization checks.
- The specification assumes the agent is running on an operating system that supports programmatic rebooting of a single process.
